# pathVisuals
pathVisuals is a path visualizer which is built in pygame library in Python3.

It includes 4 path finding algorithms:

- ### Dijkstra algorithm
   The best algorithm to find the shortest path between the source and the destination. It uses a priority queue to help find the shortest path.

- ### A* Search Algorithm
   A* Search Algorithm is a simple and efficient search algorithm that can be used to find the optimal path between two nodes in a graph. The A* Search Algorithm also uses a heuristic function that provides additional information regarding how far away from the goal node we are. This function is used in conjunction with the f-heap data structure in order to make searching more efficient.

- ### BFS
    A bute force algorithm which helps in finding a path (it may or may not be the shortest path).
